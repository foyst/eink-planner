Do you want to be right?\nOr do you want to do what's right?
Do you want to win the argument,\nor solve the problem?
Vision Drives Decision
Feel the Fear, and do it anyway
Winning Hearts and Minds
VUCA - Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous
OODA - Observe, Orient, Decision, Action
Listen to learn, NOT to reply!
No one is ever too important to\nSweep the Sheds
Aggregation of Marginal Gains\nCompounding of 1% improvements
Vision without action is a daydream.\nAction without vision is a nightmare
A safe space is a beautiful place\nBut nothing ever grows there
Hard work beats talent...\nWhen talent fails to work hard
