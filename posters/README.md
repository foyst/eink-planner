# How to add posters

Find images of your favourite quotes or posters and drop them into this folder.

Use your favourite imaging software to crop them to size and remove any unwanted areas. It might be necessary to do some pre-processing of the image so it looks well in black and white.

The eink-poster service will pick a random image from this folder to display everytime it is run.

It will automatically resize the image to fit the screen and center it vertically, so you don't need to worry about doing this when editing the image.

You can set the Debug_Mode flag to 1 in conf.ini to preview the output of the image on your computer before publishing to the screen.
